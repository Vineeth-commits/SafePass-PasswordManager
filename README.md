# SafePass-PasswordManager

## Problem Statement
The importance of passwords and other sensitive details is 
essential. Most people use very weak passwords and reuse 
them on different sites. Strong passwords with numbers and 
special characters provide strong protection.
Some also store their passwords on text files with no 
encryption what so every, making them vulnerable. A 
password vault solves all these problems and helps to 
organize your accounts with also timely reminder to change 
your password frequently. One need not remember his 
passwords. The only password to remember is the master 
password to open the vault. This makes the process safe and easy.
A Password Manager like SafePass is used to store confidential data without worrying about security. It can be used to save and controls passwords, private notes, credit and debit card details, PINs, software keys and more which require protection. This project demonstrates the usage of Data Structures and key algorithms. Concepts like pointers, stacks, queues, trees, heap and graph . In this we use basic encryption to store details in it. All the stored information can be accessed under a username and master password that must be entered by the user to access the sensitive content. The user can create new entries and delete them based on his choice. This project is built in C programming language. The user interface would be on a command line as of now.

## Functionality
Initializing a vault: A user can create a vault to store his 
passwords, PINS, and other private information in his 
separate vault. Each vault is designated for a specific 
user. A user can access the vault by entering his 
username and master password created at the time of 
initializing a vault.

Retrieving an entry: A password or any other entry is
displayed to the user.

Rename a password: If a password or any entry is added 
with a wrong name it can be updated.

Generate a password: It can also create a randomly 
generated password of desired length of alphanumeric
characters.

Searching and deleting a vault can also be done.
